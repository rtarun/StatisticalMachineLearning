# EM Algorithm
Here, we apply the EM algorithm and a finite mixture of multinomial distributions to the image segmentation problem. Image segmentation refers to the task of dividing an input image into regions of pixels that “belong together” (which is about as formal and precise a definition as you will be able to find in the literature.) One way to approach image segmentation is to extract a suitable set of features from the image and apply a clustering algorithm to them. The clusters output by the algorithm can then be regarded as the image segments. The features we will use are histograms drawn from small regions in the image.
